Step Tracker Website (C# / ASP.NET)

Building on my data analysis project, this is a simple C# web application that allows users to enter their daily step count for the week. The website calculates the total weekly steps and, based on the result, displays a personalised recommendation. 

Features
	•	Users enter their name and their steps for each day (Monday–Sunday)
	•	Backend calculates:
	•	Total weekly steps
	•	Average daily steps
	•	Displays a personalised recommendation based on the average
